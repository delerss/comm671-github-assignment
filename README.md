## Introduction

### Hi, my name is Dela! 

I'm currently a **_personal trainer_** who has vast experience in the biotech field but I'm looking to enter the web development space. I have beginner experience in **HTML, CSS, and Javascript** but it has been a few years since I've actively used those languages given my career shift. 

I also have experience working with **SQL** from my previous job as a support engineer at Dotmatics. Currently I am enrolled in a Web Development course through the San Diego College of Continuing Education to brush up on my web development skills. 

Fun Facts About Me:
* I've competed in a bodybuilding competition
* I don't know how to swim
* I love cats

Here's a cute picture of a cat:
