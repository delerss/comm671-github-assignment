## Introduction

Hi, my name is Dela! I'm currently a personal trainer who has vast experience in the biotech field but I'm looking to enter the web development space. I have beginner experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript but it has been a few years since I've actively used those languages given my career shift. I also have experience working with SQL from my previous job as a support engineer at Dotmatics. Currently I am enrolled in a Web Development course through the San Diego College of Continuing Education to brush up on my web development skills.
